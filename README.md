### ABOUT 
There were two people in the group who exercised as a hobby, so I thought about working on a project based on exercise.

1. Project.py
   This code utilizes the open-source library called Mediapipe, developed and maintained by Google, along with OpenCV. It is designed to detect and track the pose of a user through a webcam, extracting the positions and angles of the joints.

2. Pose.py
   This code calculates the number of exercises based on the angles measured by the Pose.py module. It uses a detector object to find the pose and track the positions of joints. There are separate functions for measuring push-up and squat exercises.
